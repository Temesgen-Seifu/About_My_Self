    <Br><div id="part1"><p style="color:blueviolet; "><i style="color: darkviolet;">My name is Temesgen Seifu Agiza. I am 21 years old. I was born in 1992EC. I have both parents and they both live in wolkitie.
        My father's name is Seifu Agiza and my mother's name is Girmanesh Gebre Eyesus. I have five brothers and two sisters. I am the fourth 
        children in my family member. I have sarted my education in 1999 in Ethiopian calendar in the school of <b>Marathon primary school.</b>
        At that time, there were a large numbers of brilliant students and I was one of the students who have been struggling to succeed in life.</i>
       <br> <div style="color: brown;">To tell the truth, there was a great competition amongst us. Neverthless, the competition; i ranked first and scored a high result. That was 
        the beginning of my new chapter for myself. I was initiated too much and tried to study more and more.</div> After I have completed grade four from
        <b><i>Marathon school,</i></b> I went to an other school which is named <b>Terhogne primary and geneal seconary school.</b> I studied more and 
        I also ranked first in the whole. That was inspired me surprisingly. And after I have completed grade eight, I went to an other school 
        so-called <b><i>Gunchire preparatory and general secondary school.</i></b> <div> <b><i style="color:black;">Do you need to see where the location of this school?</i></b></div>

        the school. There life became challenging and I did more. fortunately, 
        my dream getting better and better. I ranked frist again in the class as well as in the whole. After I have completed grade nine, 
        unfortunately, I had got some health problem. That challenged my life. And I was suppressed to dropout from the school. Then I was taking
    medication at ALART hospital for one and half years. After a year ago, restarted my education again. There are many peoples who 
supported to me to start my education. But, the man that I have never forgotten is <dl><dt style="color: red;">Teacher Marelign</dt><dd>who was our chemistry teacher at that time 
    and now, I think he is teaching around shegolle,Addis Ababa. He was so kind and sociable with anybody.
